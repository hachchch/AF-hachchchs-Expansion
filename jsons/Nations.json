		"startIntroPart1": "Hello, Sheeta Laxman. There is 24 years have passed since we were defeated in the war, deployed the Light Sail, and miraculously drifted to this planet. Also it is meaning 24 years since humanity reached Alpha Centauri. Life on Alpha Centauri was not hopeless, as it had a complete ecosystem and was even suitable for breeding. We are beginning to completely dominate nature, just as our ancestors did on Earth in the past.",
		"startIntroPart2": "This is the main report from the envoy, extremely artificial radio waves have been detected by the radio wave measuring equipment. There are rumors at the camp that it's an alien invasion, but it turns out the radio waves are the same as those used in the old earth. If that's true, finally we can go back to our home system, but their goal will be to take ownership of this planet. We got here before anyone else and are building camp. Shouldn't we assert our vested interests in this alpha frontier? Can you build a colony that stands the test of time?",

		"startIntroPart1": "Greetings, spaceship commander Kelber Heimdall of the Core Tech Society. After the collapse of Old Earth, we assembled scientists to this community on the moons of Uranus and solved the power shortage problem on Uranus by inventing an artificial solar core. Today, the core generators we created account for over 90% of the total electricity used on Uranus and are essential to the people there. With this core generator of ours, we can build a spaceship that can reach other solor systems such as alpha centauri.",
		"startIntroPart2": "First, let's fly to Alpha Centauri. But we still only have one spaceship and one core generator, so failure is not an option. If this project is successful, it will provide significant funding to the Core Tech Society and put us in a position to lead the way in space exploration. So I hope you succeed in building a new world on there. Can you build a colony that stands the test of time?",
